This VHDL indent file will help indent a VHDL file in Vim with the operator '='.
To indent the whole file, do 'gg=G'. See ":help ="

Previous good work has been done by N. J. Heo & Janez Strangelj (see vimscript#766). However, Heo & Strangelj's script was lacking in terms of alignment for assignment statements that continued on for more than one line, among other things.

This script covers a broad set of VHDL keywords, and performs proper alignment on port/generic mappings & on the RHS of assignment operators.

To disable alignment of generic/port mappings:
  :let g:vhdl_indent_genportmap = 0

To disable alignment of right-hand side assignment "<=" statements:
  :let g:vhdl_indent_rhsassign = 0

The two options above are enabled by default. To change them, place either of the above in ".vimrc".

In later versions of Vim 7.1 and above, access help documentation with:
  :help ft-vhdl-indent

Please send feedback and bug reports via e-mail. Much appreciated :)
